I am from New Zealand and have been living in the UK for over thirty years, living in London for 15 years before settling here in Bristol for twenty years now. 

In 2013  I joined the Airbnb Community offering homestay accommodation to travellers & visitors, university students, those looking to relocate and or work in Bristol for short stay visits. 

My previous experience of homestay hosting involved working closely with an established Bristol English Language School, 2010 -2013. I was valued by them for my contribution to homestay experiences offered to their foreign language students. 

With the unprecedented events of the 2020 Covid 19 Pandemic, I closed my doors to hosting from March 2020 until  
June 2021. The three lockdown phases, in particular, though challenging at times, offered me & I hope others some extraordinary experiences, a time to pause, reflect, restore, regroup. So much to fathom during them & in the uncertain times we now continue to face. Gentle, gentle. 

It was with some reticence I concede, that I opened my doors to hosting again in the last weeks of June 2021. I am rediscovering again the enriching experience of sharing my home, creating a welcoming, relaxed & comfortable experience for others, a space where connecting in good conversation is valued & respected as much as the need for privacy & discretion. 

I feel immense gratitude for the experiences I have shared & been privilege to with guests through Airbnb hosting & I look forward to the many more experiences to come my way.

I love hosting and have done so for several years. Meeting new people and making them feel welcome and comfortable is a treat!
My interest in people extends to my work - I teach yoga and am a trauma therapist. I run my therapy business from home so this may limit your accessibility to the kitchen during the daytime - no problem if you are at work!
You may find me practicing yoga while you stay - often in the garden in the summer months.
My husband is often away working as a choreographer in the USA, so when you stay it may be me or both of us here but I will let you know.
I have a BFA in Dance, and used to live and work in Holland and New York City. I have studied business, philosophy, creative writing and love learning.
I am looking forward to hosting you - please get in touch!

I am from New Zealand and have been living in the UK for over thirty years, living in London for 15 years before settling here in Bristol for twenty years now. 

In 2013  I joined the Airbnb Community offering homestay accommodation to travellers & visitors, university students, those looking to relocate and or work in Bristol for short stay visits. 

My previous experience of homestay hosting involved working closely with an established Bristol English Language School, 2010 -2013. I was valued by them for my contribution to homestay experiences offered to their foreign language students. 

With the unprecedented events of the 2020 Covid 19 Pandemic, I closed my doors to hosting from March 2020 until  
June 2021. The three lockdown phases, in particular, though challenging at times, offered me & I hope others some extraordinary experiences, a time to pause, reflect, restore, regroup. So much to fathom during them & in the uncertain times we now continue to face. Gentle, gentle. 

It was with some reticence I concede, that I opened my doors to hosting again in the last weeks of June 2021. I am rediscovering again the enriching experience of sharing my home, creating a welcoming, relaxed & comfortable experience for others, a space where connecting in good conversation is valued & respected as much as the need for privacy & discretion. 

I feel immense gratitude for the experiences I have shared & been privilege to with guests through Airbnb hosting & I look forward to the many more experiences to come my way.

I love looking after our house and garden, and making it as homely and cosy as I can, and I enjoy welcoming guests to our house. I like to try to make your stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible.  I do like to host guests who are happy to be considerate in return . Fortunately, for most guests , this comes naturally!

I love nature, and like to try to be as environmentally friendly as I can in the way that I live, and use environmentally friendly products in the house. I also try where possible to minimise plastic so  you will find there is soap rather than shower gel in the bathroom. I don't buy any food containing palm oil, as this product is instrumental in the widespread destruction of the rainforest habitat. However, that said, I do attempt to use up food and/or bathroom products left behind by guests, as I do not like waste, so if you see any non-environmentally friendly items around then these may have been left by guests. My garden is a wild garden, which I have designed to be good for biodiversity,  including birds, frogs, toads, spiders, insects and a fox ! So it often looks quite overgrown, as wildlife loves a good rambling garden :) 

I have two B&B rooms in the house , so you may find other guests staying here at the same time as myself and you. In the summer I also have the summerhouse on Air BNB.

 Please make sure you have read and are happy with all my house rules as some of them are quite specific and may be different to other Air BNB houses that you may have stayed in before. 

I give a minimum of 2% of my profits to charity every month, mainly animal welfare and environmental charities such as Marine Conservation  Society, Cruelty Free International, the Orangutan Foundation, but also the NSPCC and Womankind, a charity which works to reduce violence to women in certain countries which have a cultural history of violence against women. 

So you can be happy in the knowledge that the money you pay me will be spent wisely, on charities and  products which lead to the caring of our environment, animals, and humans, rather than contribute to our destruction.

 My hobbies are singing, music, dancing, gardening, writing, sewing, and many others!!

Laurence named our home ""The Wendy Estate"" when Mum started sharing our home with AirBnB and various other lodgers she met & supported over the years. 

It was Mum's greatest wish that we continue to host our beloved cabin and treehouse on Airbnb and we hope to do so in a very 'Wendy like' fashion. 

Written by Wendy in 2015 ; ""I am a Guardian reading, permaculture type, I work part time, love travelling, all things garden and 20th Century design. I like  sharing my lovely space with other people I am lucky to live in a rural oasis in the heart of a beautiful city which I know really well! ""

Ruby is the eldest & bossiest, she'll be making sure the rooms are up to scratch and there's enough tea and coffee in for you. Ruby is trained as a photographer but also knows all the best 'value for money' eateries & how to get about the city on public transport. 


Laurence is he's the music man of the three of us. He will tell you about the best forms of night life & the music culture of Bristol. 

Guy is the money making entrepreneur, he knows how to live a luxurious life and will give you ideas for how to have a truly luxurious time in Bristol.  

We all love food, music, and socialising. We live in a house full of books and many lovely items that make this house & the outbuildings our home and we look forward to continue sharing the 'Wendy Estate' with the rest of the world.

Life motto? We only have one so make the most of it.

We love to socialise with guests, but also completely understand if you just want a room and don't necessarily want to engage, the separate living room is perfect if you want your own space. We love our unique house overlooking Bristol with a fab city garden. It's a town house so you never feel on top of each other which makes the accommodation feel quite private.

 I moved to Bristol 30 years ago and love it more each year!

Currently I work for a small Arts on Prescription organisation based in Gloucester.

I enjoy travel (self catering style), meeting folk, camping, cold water swimming, walking, gardening and a laugh. I'm a pescatarian.

The house has solar panels & I use eco products as much as I can.  I have a cat, Chomsky.

I've always worked with a wide range of people, I'm used to and enjoy living in shared housing  & have done  for most of my adult life.  I  currently have a full time lodger as well.

I'd say I'm warm, friendly, respectful and informal.

I'd like you to enjoy your time in Bristol.

Currently I work for a small Arts on Prescription organisation based in Gloucester.

I enjoy travel (self catering style), meeting folk, camping, cold water swimming, walking, gardening and a laugh. I'm a pescatarian.

The house has solar panels & I use eco products as much as I can.  I have a cat, Chomsky.

I've always worked with a wide range of people, I'm used to and enjoy living in shared housing  & have done  for most of my adult life.  I  currently have a full time lodger as well.

I moved from London in 2010 and have never looked back!  It’s such a fantastic, diverse city with so much going on.  The food, bar and music scene is incredible and, in my opinion, rivals London, yet it is relatively inexpensive.

I have lived in my beautiful flat for 6.5 years and restored it myself in my spare time.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  It is on the reception floor of a Victorian home, so it has the most grand reception room in the building with the traditional features of original shutters, cornicing and huge marble fireplace, ceiling rose, and deep skirting boards.  Please understand that the building is >150 years old so it has its quirks and it is not well sound-proofed.  My neighbours (upstairs and downstairs) are very friendly and I’m sure they’ll welcome you.

I am away on a short-term basis so it still very much looks like a home, albeit a bit less cluttered!  I hope you find it a good home-from-home during your stay in Bristol.

The location is fantastic and is a 30-second walk from the bars and restaurants on Whiteladies Road.  It is also central to Clifton, Gloucester/Cheltenham Road and the city centre/shopping district.  I walk everywhere from my flat and you can be at all these places in an easy 20 minute walk in either direction.  Equally, if you fancy getting out of town to the local countryside or nearby cities like Bath and Cheltenham, this is remarkably easy and quick (just try not to travel in rush hour!).

My favourite place to eat in Bristol is the superb tapas bar called Bravas, which is literally at the end of my road and it is always an easy stumble home after one too many dishes of patatas bravas!  I can thoroughly recommend the Iberico pork and deep fried aubergine in molasses.  Trust me!  I recommend booking as it’s a small place and very popular.

There’s a quirky bar called HMSS (Her Majesty’s Secret Service) right next to Clifton Down Shopping Centre, within a few minutes’ walk.  It does fantastic cocktails that are elaborately and imaginatively served.

There’s also a fantastic brunch spot at the end of my road (corner of Hampton Park and Cotham Hill) called Rubicon Too and they have seating outside, which is a wonderful sun-trap on a sunny morning, but equally lovely on a colder weekend day.  The pub opposite the cafe, The Brewhouse, has a lovely outside seating area (opposite Rubicon Too), which is very popular in the summer.  It is one of the few spots in Bristol where you can bask in the sun whilst nursing a glass of wine or cold beer.

There are all sorts of wonderful attractions in the city centre, also walking distance or a short bus ride.  The bus stop is about a minutes’ walk away, as is Clifton Down shopping centre with all the local amenities you could need, including a large supermarket (Sainsburys), pharmacy (Boots) and stationers (WH Smith).

Clifton Suspension Bridge is c25 minute walk away, or a quick taxi ride, and Brunel’s SS Great Britain is also relatively close, on the south side of the river.  There are various Banksy murals dotted around Bristol too.

If you’re in Bristol for work, my flat is a few minutes’ walk from the BBC, about 15-20 minutes from Bristol Royal Infirmary (main hospital) and c10 minutes from the university (city centre campus).

I hope you enjoy your stay in Bristol, and my flat, as much as I do.

Best wishes,
Andie.

Mum worked as a Social Worker in the Adoption department and ran the AirBnB on the side, with the help of us; her three children (Ruby, Guy & Laurence) and her friends. Laurence named our home ""The Wendy Estate"" when Mum started sharing our home with AirBnB and various other lodgers she met & supported over the years. 

It was Mum's greatest wish that we continue to host our beloved cabin and treehouse on Airbnb and we hope to do so in a very 'Wendy like' fashion. 

Written by Wendy in 2015 ; ""I am a Guardian reading, permaculture type, I work part time, love travelling, all things garden and 20th Century design. I like  sharing my lovely space with other people I am lucky to live in a rural oasis in the heart of a beautiful city which I know really well! ""

A little bit about us... 

Ruby is the eldest & bossiest, she'll be making sure the rooms are up to scratch and there's enough tea and coffee in for you. Ruby is trained as a photographer but also knows all the best 'value for money' eateries & how to get about the city on public transport. 


Laurence is he's the music man of the three of us. He will tell you about the best forms of night life & the music culture of Bristol. 

Guy is the money making entrepreneur, he knows how to live a luxurious life and will give you ideas for how to have a truly luxurious time in Bristol.  

We all love food, music, and socialising. We live in a house full of books and many lovely items that make this house & the outbuildings our home and we look forward to continue sharing the 'Wendy Estate' with the rest of the world.

I love looking after our house and garden, and making it as homely and cosy as I can, and I enjoy welcoming guests to our house. I like to try to make your stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible.  I do like to host guests who are happy to be considerate in return . Fortunately, for most guests , this comes naturally!

I love nature, and like to try to be as environmentally friendly as I can in the way that I live, and use environmentally friendly products in the house. I also try where possible to minimise plastic so  you will find there is soap rather than shower gel in the bathroom. I don't buy any food containing palm oil, as this product is instrumental in the widespread destruction of the rainforest habitat. However, that said, I do attempt to use up food and/or bathroom products left behind by guests, as I do not like waste, so if you see any non-environmentally friendly items around then these may have been left by guests. My garden is a wild garden, which I have designed to be good for biodiversity,  including birds, frogs, toads, spiders, insects and a fox ! So it often looks quite overgrown, as wildlife loves a good rambling garden :) 

I have two B&B rooms in the house , so you may find other guests staying here at the same time as myself and you. In the summer I also have the summerhouse on Air BNB.

 Please make sure you have read and are happy with all my house rules as some of them are quite specific and may be different to other Air BNB houses that you may have stayed in before. 

I give a minimum of 2% of my profits to charity every month, mainly animal welfare and environmental charities such as Marine Conservation  Society, Cruelty Free International, the Orangutan Foundation, but also the NSPCC and Womankind, a charity which works to reduce violence to women in certain countries which have a cultural history of violence against women. 

So you can be happy in the knowledge that the money you pay me will be spent wisely, on charities and  products which lead to the caring of our environment, animals, and humans, rather than contribute to our destruction.

 My hobbies are singing, music, dancing, gardening, writing, sewing, and many others!!

It’s a short hop to the city centre (ask for a three-stop hop on any local bus and you’ll be in Cabot Circus in no time). We have free on-street parking right outside our door, so you don’t have to worry about pay and display or the parking permits which now place restrictions on motorists in many other parts of the city. If you don’t have a car, that’s no problem, as there is a regular bus into town that stops on our street, or you can take the train from Stapleton Road station and be at Temple Meads or Clifton in no time. If you like a good walk, you can get to Broadmead in around 40 minutes by following the Bristol and Bath Railway Path into town. However, if you want to feel like a real Bristolian, the preferred way to get about Britain’s first ‘cycling city’ is by bike, of course. Our house is handily located next to the Bristol and Bath Railway Path, so why not bring your bikes? The ride to Bath through the Avon Valley is stunningI am a Bristolian born and raised; my wife and I met here at university. Bristol really is a beautiful city. We love taking walks around the Floating Harbour, ensuring we take time to stop for coffee at the Olive Shed, a swift half at the Nova Scotia Hotel, or maybe even a delicious bite to eat at the containers on Wapping Wharf. We also enjoy taking in the stunning views from the top of Brandon Hill before checking out the quirky, artsy shops on Park Street. We always like to look in at the Boston Tea Party on Park Street, where the ‘secret garden’ provides perfect respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. We’ve owned our house in Easton since July 2019. Recently voted one of the top 50 coolest neighbourhoods in the world by TimeOut Magazine (September 2019), Easton really does have something for everyone. You will find trendy cafés selling excellent coffee and home-made cakes, world-beating curry restaurants, and plenty of friendly local boozers. We like to visit the gorgeous Este Kitchen for coffee and brunch. Just opposite, the Greenbank pub is a great spot for lunch or an evening pint or two; their guest ales change all the time and they have a decent selection of board games. If you’re planning a quiet night in, G Bros Pizza will do you a perfectly baked pizza. The M’Sala Library truly is one of the best curries I’ve ever eaten; be sure to ask for the vegetable samosas which are to die for. For the discerning foodie, the famous Bristol Sweet Mart on St Mark’s Road is a five-minute walk away. There you’ll find ingredients for sale from all four corners of the globe. Worth a trip, even just for a browse. We look forward to hosting you soon in beautiful BS5. Chris, Justine and baby Louis.

Welcome to a modern, stylish and newly renovated house. We tried to think about every single detail that you would need during your stay. There are three double and one single room in our house. It is close to public transportation for city centre and all other locations in and around Bristol. 

Most importantly Metrobus which takes you very quickly to your target destination is in short walking distance. Wifi connection, garden sitting area, study and work space is available in every room. We would really appreciate if you help us keep the house sparkly clean by strictly applying no shoes, pets and smoking policy during your stay. 

This just a very short description, a lot more comfort and relaxing night is just a click away.

Feel free to ask any questions you have.


Looking forward to host you soon.

Tried to leave a few times for the countryside - but always get drawn back by my friends. Now i've found my beautiful urban/rural village I'm settled. 

 I'm 43. I run an international charity three days a week and the rest of the time I write songs, do yoga and bring up my 8 year old daughter.  So I'm a funny mixture of super organized and professional and kind of laid back. 

As a host I aim to make you feel as comfortable as possible. The house is well loved and well lived in which makes it cosy - but as a new build it has a modern spacious design feel to it as well. I've traveled a lot myself and I have had a stream of international guests renting out another flat of mine so I am used to the kind of information and support that guests might need.

This gives us access to several miles of paths that link Eastville Park (with its children’s playground), Snuff Mills river and woods, Oldbury Court Estate, Stoke Park Estate and Purdown.  We regularly do a 2 hours circular walk from the house to Purdown and back that involves only a few hundred yards on roads, the rest being footpaths along the river through woods and fields and over hills.<br /><br />There is plenty of wildlife to be seen in season.  There are resident buzzards and sparrowhawks in the valley along with jays, jackdaws, crows, magpies and the inevitable seagulls.

I manage a number of properties for family and friends and I love welcoming new visitors. I know the city like the back of my hand so I'd love to tell you about all the things that go on in our vibrant city. I look forward to welcoming you and making your stay one to remember.

Welcome to a modern, stylish and newly renovated house. We tried to think about every single detail that you would need during your stay. There are three double and one single room in our house. It is close to public transportation for city centre and all other locations in and around Bristol. 

Most importantly Metrobus which takes you very quickly to your target destination is in short walking distance. Wifi connection, garden sitting area, study and work space is available in every room. We would really appreciate if you help us keep the house sparkly clean by strictly applying no shoes, pets and smoking policy during your stay. 

This just a very short description, a lot more comfort and relaxing night is just a click away.

Feel free to ask any questions you have.


Looking forward to host you soon.


Many thanks,
